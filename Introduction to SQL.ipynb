Normalization rules break huge tables into smaller tables and use relationships to connect them. The goal of SQL normalisation is to reduce duplicate (repetitive) data and ensure logical data storage.\n\n# 12. What is Denormalization?\nDenormalization is a database optimization technique in which duplicated data is added to one or more tables. In a relational database, this can help us avoid costly joins. It's important to note that denormalization does not imply the absence of normalization. It is an optimization technique that is used once normalization has been completed.\n\n# 13A What are all the different normalizations?\n1. Unnormalized form or UNF\n2. First Normal Form or 1NF\n3. Second Normal Form or 2NF\n4. Third Normal Form or 3NF\n5. Elementary key normal form or EKNF\n6. Boyce Codd Normal Form or BCNF\n7. Fourth normal form or 4NF\n8. Essential tuple normal form or ETNF\n9. Fifth normal form or 5NF\n10. Domain-key normal form or DKNF\n11. Sixth normal form or 6NF\n\n# 13b.The normal forms can be divided into 5 forms\n1. Unnormalized form (UNF) \nUnnormalized form (UNF), also known as an unnormalized relation or non first normal form (N1NF or NF2) in database normalization, is a database data model (data organization in a database) that does not meet any of the database normalization constraints defined by the relational model. Non-relational or NoSQL databases are database systems that support data that is not normalized.\n\n\n2. Elementary key normal form (EKNF)\nBecause elementary key normal form (EKNF) is a slight improvement on third normal form, EKNF tables are always in 3NF. When there are multiple distinct compound keys that overlap, this occurs. In such circumstances, the overlapping column may include redundant data (s).\n\n\n3. Boyce–Codd normal form (BCNF)\nThe Boyce–Codd normal form (or BCNF or 3.5NF) is a database normalization form. It's a more powerful variation of the third normal form (3NF). Raymond F. Boyce and Edgar F. Codd created BCNF in 1974 to handle some types of anomalies not addressed by 3NF as initially established.\n\n4. Essential tuple normal form (ETNF)\nIt is an improved version of the third normal form, hence EKNF is in 3rd Normal Form by default. There is redundancy in the overlapping column when there are more than one unique compound key and the keys overlap. Thus, if every non-trivial functional dependency in the 3NF relation requires either a superkey or an elementary key's subkey, it is in EKNF.\n5. Domain-key normal form (DKNF)\nThe domain-key normal form (DK/NF) is a database normalization normal form that requires the database to have no constraints other than domain and key constraints. A domain constraint describes the values that are acceptable for a particular property, whereas a key constraint specifies the attributes that uniquely identify a row in a table.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 14. What is a View?\n​\nA view is a database subset that is created from a query and saved as a permanent object. Although a view's definition is permanent, the data it contains is dynamic and changes based on when the view is accessed.\nA view is a representation of a subset of the data in a table. They have the ability to combine and simplify many tables into a single virtual table. Because the database just holds the view definition and not the data, they take up extremely little storage space. They can also give results for various calculations (such as total and average) alongside the recorded data, as well as control the extent to which tables are exposed to the outer world\n​\n# 15.What is an Index?\nIndexes are special lookup tables that can be used by the database search engine to speed up data retrieval. An index is just a reference to data in a table. A database index is analogous to the index in the back of a book.\nAn index is a data structure that is small, fast, and optimized for fast lookups. It's great for linking relational tables and searching huge databases. Because SQL indexes are essentially a performance aid, they are most useful when a database increases in size.\n​\n# 16A. What are all the different types of indexes?\n1. Clustered Index\n2. Non-Clustered Index\n3. Unique Index\n4. Filtered Index\n5. Columnstore Index\n6. Hash Index\n​\n# 16B. There are three types of indexes -List and explain\n1. Primary Index\n2. Secondary Index\n3. Clustering Index\n​\n# Primary Index\n A primary index is an ordered file with two fields and records of a predetermined length. The primary key of the data file is replicated in an ordered way in the first field of the index, and the second field of the ordered file contains a pointer to the data-block where a record containing the key is available.\n \n The primary Index is also further divided into two types.\n​\n* Dense Index\nIn a dense index, a record is created for every search key valued in the database. This helps you to search faster but needs more space to store index records. In this Indexing, method records contain search key value and points to the real record on the disk.\n​\n* Sparse Index\nIt is an index record that appears for only some of the values in the file. Sparse Index helps you to resolve the issues of dense Indexing in DBMS. In this method of indexing technique, a range of index columns stores the same data block address, and when data needs to be retrieved, the block address will be fetched.\n​\n# Secondary Index\nThe secondary Index in DBMS can be generated by a field which has a unique value for each record, and it should be a candidate key. It is also known as a non-clustering index.\n​\nThis two-level database indexing technique is used to reduce the mapping size of the first level. For the first level, a large range of numbers is selected because of this; the mapping size always remains small.\n​\n#  Clustering Index\nIn a clustered index, records themselves are stored in the Index and not pointers. Sometimes the Index is created on non-primary key columns which might not be unique for each record. In such a situation, you can group two or more columns to get the unique values and create an index which is called clustered Index. This also helps you to identify the record faster.\n​\n​","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 17. What is a Cursor?\nA cursor is a type of temporary memory or workstation. It is allocated by the database server when a user performs DML actions on a table. Database Tables are stored in cursors.\nTypes of Cursor\n\n*** Implicit Cursors**:\nImplicit Cursors are also known as Default Cursors of SQL SERVER. These Cursors are allocated by SQL SERVER when the user performs DML operations.\n\n*** Explicit Cursors** :\nExplicit Cursors are Created by Users whenever the user requires them. Explicit Cursors are used for Fetching data from Table in Row-By-Row Manner.\n\n# 18. What is a relationship and what are they? \nIn the context of databases, a relationship is a situation in which one table has a foreign key that references the primary key of the other table. Relationships enable relational databases to partition and store data in various tables while also connecting distinct data pieces.\n# Types of relationships\n*** One-to-One Relationship**\n\nSuch a relationship exists when each record of one table is related to only one record of the other table.\n\n*** One-to-Many or Many-to-One Relationship**\n\nSuch a relationship exists when each record of one table can be related to one or more than one record of the other table. This relationship is the most common relationship found. A one-to-many relationship can also be said as a many-to-one relationship depending upon the way we view it.\n\n*** Many-to-Many Relationship**\n\nSuch a relationship exists when each record of the first table can be related to one or more than one record of the second table and a single record of the second table can be related to one or more than one record of the first table. A many-to-many relationship can be seen as a two one-to-many relationship which is linked by a 'linking table' or 'associate table'. The linking table links two tables by having fields which are the primary key of the other two tables.\n# 19 What is a query?\nA query is a request for data or information from one or more database tables. This data could be in the form of pictorials, graphs, or complicated results, such as trend analyses from data-mining tools, or it could be in the form of results produced by Structured Query Language (SQL). To run a variety of simple to complex database queries, one of several distinct query languages can be utilized.\n# 20 What is subquery?\nA subquery is a query that is nested within another query. A subquery is incorporated into a bigger query. INNER QUERY OR NESTED QUERY is another name for a subquery. The main query, also known as the parent query or outer query, receives data from a subquery. A subquery is a SELECT statement that is embedded in another SQL statement's clause.\nA subquery can be placed in:\n* SELECT clause\n* FROM Clause\n* WHERE Clause\n* HAVING Clause\nof the parent query or outer query.\n# 21 What are the types of subquery?\n\n**Single row subquery**\n\n* Returns only single row.\n* Uses single row comparison operators\n\n**Multiple row subquery**\n* Returns more than one row.\n* Uses multiple row comparison operators like IN, ANY and ALL.\n\n**Multiple column subquery**\n* Returns more than one\n* There may be one or more rows.\n\n**Correlated subquery**\n\n* Subquery references one or more column from the table referred in the parent query.\n* Correlated query is evaluated once for each row processed by the parent query.\n\n# 22. What is a stored procedure?\nA stored procedure is a collection of Structured Query Language (SQL) statements with a common name that are stored  in a relational database management system (RDBMS) to be reused and shared by various programs. Stored procedures have the ability to access and edit data in a database, but they are not connected to a single database or object, which has a number of advantages.\n\n# 23 .What is a trigger?\nTriggers are SQL statements that are performed automatically whenever the database changes. Triggers are run when specified events (INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE) occur in a specific table. These triggers serve to maintain the data's integrity by updating the database's data in a regular manner.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 24 What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE commands?\n**DELETE** is a DML (Data Manipulation Language) command that is used to specify which row(tuple) from a table or relation we wish to remove or delete.

The TRUNCATE command is faster than the DELETE command. Even after using the TRUNCATE command, we can rollback the data, just like we can with DELETE.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"TRUNCATE TABLE  employees;\n","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n# 25. What are local and global variables and their differences?\n**Local variable** is declared inside a function whereas **Global variable**  is declared outside the function.\n\n**Local variables** are created when the function has started execution and is lost when the function terminates, on the other hand, **Global variable** is created as execution starts and is lost when the program ends.\n\n**Local variable** doesn’t provide data sharing whereas **Global variable** provides data sharing.\n\n**Local variables** are stored on the stack whereas the **Global variable** are stored on a fixed location decided by the compiler.\n\nParameters passing is required for **local variables** whereas it is not necessary for a **global variable**\n# 26.What is a constraint?\nConstraints are the rules that a table's data columns must follow. These are used to restrict the types of information that can be entered into a table. This guarantees that the data in the database is accurate and reliable. Constraints can be applied at the column or table level.\n\n# 27. What is data Integrity?\nData integrity is defined as the maintenance, assurance, accuracy, consistency of data over its entire life-cycle i.e. throughout its design, implementation, and usage stages.Data integrity refers to the overall accuracy, completeness, and reliability of data. It can be specified by the lack of variation between two instances or consecutive updates of a record, indicating that your information is error-free. It also corresponds to the security of data pertaining to regulatory compliance.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 28.What is Auto Increment?\nAuto-increment allows a unique \nnumber to be generated automatically when a new record is inserted into a table.Often this is the primary key field that we would like to be created automatically every time a new record is inserted.\n\n# 29.What is the difference between Cluster and Non-Cluster Index?\nA **Clustered index** is a type of index in which table records are physically reordered to match the index, While a **Non-Clustered index** is a special type of index in which logical order of index does not match physical stored order of the rows on disk.\n\n# 30. What is Datawarehouse?\nA data warehouse is a relational database management system (RDBMS) built to suit transaction processing system requirements. It's a broad term that refers to any centralized data store that may be queried for commercial purposes. It's a database that holds data that's meant to help people make decisions.It's a collection of decision-making aids aimed at assisting knowledge workers (executives, managers, and analysts) in making better and more informed judgments.\n\n# 31 What is Self-Join?\nA self join is when a table is connected to itself (also known as Unary relationships), especially when the table has a FOREIGN KEY that references its own PRIMARY KEY. To join a table to itself, each row of the table is combined with itself and with every other row of the table.\n\n# 32 What is Cross-Join?\n\nThe SQL CROSS JOIN produces a result set which is the number of rows in the first table multiplied by the number of rows in the second table if no WHERE clause is used along with CROSS JOIN\n\n# 33 What is user defined functions?\nA user-defined function (UDF) is a common fixture in programming languages, and the main tool of programmers for creating applications with reusable code. Since programs are mostly composed of code that comes from the programmer, or in this case the user, most of it is composed of user-defined functions occasionally punctuated by built-in functions.\n\n# 34 What are all types of user defined functions?\nThere are two main types of user-defined functions in SQL based on the data they return:\n\n**Scalar functions**: These types of functions return a single value, i.e float, int, varchar, datetime, etc.\n\n**Table-Valued functions**: These functions return tables.\n\n# 35 What is collation?\nIn a database, collation describes how data is sorted and compared. The sorting rules, case, and accent sensitivity attributes for the data in the database are provided by collation.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 36.What are all different types of collation sensitivity?\n* Case-sensitive (_CS)\n*  Accent-sensitive (_AS)\n* Kana-sensitive (_KS)\n* Width-sensitive (_WS)\n* Variation-selector-sensitive (_VSS)\n* Binary (_BIN)\n* Binary-code point (_BIN2)\n* UTF-8 (_UTF8)\n\n\n# 37. Advantages and Disadvantages of Stored Procedure?\n**Advantages** :\nThe main advantages of stored procedure are given below:\n​\n1. Better Performance \nThe procedure calls are quick and efficient as stored procedures are compiled once and stored in executable form.Hence the response is quick. The executable code is automatically cached, hence lowers the memory requirements.\n​\n2. Higher Productivity –\nSince the same piece of code is used again and again so, it results in higher productivity.\n​\n1. Ease of Use –\nTo create a stored procedure, one can use any Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Then, they can be deployed on any tier of network architecture.\n​\n2. Scalability –\nStored procedures increase scalability by isolating application processing on the server.\n​\n3. Maintainability –\nMaintaining a procedure on a server is much easier then maintaining copies on various client machines, this is because scripts are in one location.\n​\n4. Security –\nAccess to the Oracle data can be restricted by allowing users to manipulate the data only through stored procedures that execute with their definer’s privileges.\n​\n\n**Disadvantages** :\n​\nThe main disadvantages of stored procedures are given below:\n​\n1. Testing –\n​\nTesting of a logic which is encapsulated inside a stored procedure is very difficult. Any data errors in handling stored procedures are not generated until runtime.\n​\n2. Debugging –\n​\nDepending on the database technology, debugging stored procedures will either be very difficult or not possible at all. Some relational databases such as SQL Server have some debugging capabilities.\n​\n3. Versioning –\n​\nVersion control is not supported by the stored procedure.\n​\n4. Cost –\n​\nAn extra developer in the form of DBA is required to access the SQL and write a better stored procedure. This will automatically incur added cost.\n​\n5. Portability –\n​\nComplex stored procedures will not always port to upgraded versions of the same database. This is specially true in case of moving from one database type(Oracle) to another database type(MS SQL Server).\n​\n\n#  38. What is Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)?\nOLTP (online transaction processing) is a class of software programs capable of supporting transaction-oriented applications on the Internet. In computing, a transaction is a sequence of discrete information exchanges that are treated as a unit. Many everyday acts involve OLTP, including online banking, online shopping and even in-store shopping when the point of sale (POS) terminal is tied to inventory management software.\n​\n# 39.What is CLAUSE?\nIn SQL, clauses are built-in functions. We can deal with data stored in the table easily with the aid of clauses. Clauses facilitate data filtering and analysis. Clauses are used to query and retrieve data from huge databases.\nWhere, and, or, like, top, etc\n​\n# 40. What is recursive stored procedure?\nRecursive stored procedure refers to a stored procedure which calls by itself until it reaches some boundary condition. This recursive function or procedure helps the programmers to use the same set of code n number of times.\n​\n# 41.What is Union, minus and Interact commands?\n​\n**UNION**\n​\nIn a database management system, the Union is a binary set operator. It's used to merge the results of two select queries into a single set. As a result, it merges two result sets into one. To put it another way, the result set obtained following the union operation is a collection of both tables' result sets.\n​\n**MINUS**\nMinus is a binary set operator in DBMS. The minus operation between two selections returns the rows that are present in the first selection but not in the second selection. The Minus operator returns only the distinct rows from the first table.\n​\n**INTERSECT**\n​\nIntersect is a binary set operator in DBMS. The intersection operation between two selections returns only the common data sets or rows between them. It should be noted that the intersection operation always returns the distinct rows. The duplicate rows will not be returned by the intersect operator.\n​\n# 42. What is an ALIAS command?\nFor the purposes of a SQL query, aliases are the temporary names assigned to a table or column. It's used when a column or table's name is changed from its original name, but the change is only temporary.Aliases are used to make table and column names easier to read.\nThe renaming is only a temporary alteration, and the table name in the original database remains unchanged.When table or column names are long or difficult to understand, aliases come in handy.\nWhen a query involves more than one table, these are the best option.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 42B.
